✅ PostgreSQL Pros

    Advanced SQL Features – Supports complex queries, window functions, CTEs, and full ACID compliance.

    Extensibility – Allows user-defined functions, custom data types, and procedural languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, etc.).

    JSON & NoSQL Support – Unlike MySQL, PostgreSQL natively supports JSONB, making it suitable for semi-structured data.

    Strong Data Integrity – Supports foreign keys, constraints, and transactional consistency.

    Concurrency Handling – Uses MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) for better read performance without locking.

    Geospatial Support – With PostGIS, it's one of the best databases for geospatial data.

    Performance for Complex Queries – Optimized for analytical workloads and complex aggregations.

    Scalability & Replication – Supports streaming replication, partitioning, and horizontal scaling.
